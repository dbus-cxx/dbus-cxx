  /**
   * \page xml2cpp dbus-cxx-xml2cpp
   *
   * \par Summary
   * \c dbus-cxx-xml2cpp generates proxy and adapter interfaces from modified DBus
   * XML introspection documents.
   *
   * \par Commands
   * - \c -x \c --xml : The xml file to process
   * - \c -p \c --prefix : A prefix to prepend to all output files
   * - \c -f \c --file : Send output to files with naming <i>class</i>_proxy.h and <i>class</i>_adapter.h
   * - \c --proxy : Generate a proxy interface
   * - \c --adapter : Generate an adapter interface
   * - \c --verbose : Generate verbose processing info
   *
   * \par Extended DBus XML attributes
   * \c dbus-cxx-xml2cpp in some cases needs information above and beyond that provided
   * in a dbus introspection document. This information can be supplied by adding
   * additional attributes to key nodes.
   *
   * \par
   * The extended attributes per XML element are:
   * - \b node
   *   - \b cppname - The base name of the c++ class adapter and proxy
   *   - \b gen-namespace - The namespace the c++ adapter and proxy will be generated into
   *   - \b orig-namespace - The namespace of the object being adapted
   *   - \b dest - Used to create a default value for the \c dest parameter of a proxy
   *   - \b path - Used to create a default value for the \c path parameter of both proxies and adapters
   *   - \b cppinclude - A free form string that will follow a \c #include line in the adapter
   *   - \b file-prefix - A per-node filename prefix prepended to the class name on output
   * - \b interface
   *   - \b ignored - If set to "1" this interface will not be built for the proxy or adapter
   * - \b signal
   *   - \b accessor - The accessor method used to obtain the adaptee's signal
   *   - \b ignored - If set to "1" this signal will not be built for the proxy or adapter
   * - \b method
   *   - \b cppname - Renames the DBus method to the provided name in the proxy and adapter
   *   - \b const - Makes the proxy method a const method (useful when subclassing virtual methods)
   *   - \b virtual - Prefixes the method with keyword virtual (useful for improving readability of virtual methods)
   * - \b arg
   *   - \b cpptype - Defines the C++ type to be used when creating proxies/adapters for this argument. Useful for wrapping enumerations.

/**
 * \page quick_start_pkgconfig Using pkgconfig
 *
 * Although this is a bit more in-depth than I planned for a quick start tutorial 
 * I thought I'd include this little blurb on using pkgconfig to help with setting your application to use dbus-cxx.
 * 
 *  dbus-cxx is distributed with two (at the current time) pkgconfig .pc files named dbus-cxx-1.0.pc and dbus-cxx-glibmm-1.0.pc. 
 *  If you installed the Fedora dbus-cxx-devel or dbus-cxx-glibmm-devel packages you'll find these files installed in a directory 
 *  named /pkgconfig under in your architecture's library directory (probably /usr/lib/pkgconfig or /usr/lib64/pkgconfig ).
 *
 * \section quick_start_pkgconfig_autotools Using pkg-config with autotools
 * If you are using autotools,
 *  modify configure.ac (or configure.in ) with the following lines:
 * \code  
 * PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PROJECT_DBUSCXX,[dbus-cxx-1.0 >= 0.7.0])
 * AC_SUBST(PROJECT_DBUSCXX_LIBS)
 * AC_SUBST(PROJECT_DBUSCXX_CFLAGS)
 * \endcode
 *
 * You can then use the symbols PROJECT_DBUSCXX_LIBS and PROJECT_DBUSCXX_CFLAGS in your Makefile.am files.
 * For example, if you have a application named fooapp your Makefile.am might look like this:
 * \code  
 * INCLUDES = $(PROJECT_DBUSCXX_CFLAGS)
 * bin_PROGRAMS = fooapp
 * fooapp_SOURCES = fooapp.cpp
 * fooapp_LDADD = $(PROJECT_DBUSCXX_LIBS)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section quick_start_pkgconfig_qt Using pkg-config with QT
 * Because of QTs signal/slot mechanism, dbus-cxx will not work directly with QT.  There are a few things that need to be
 * modified in the .pro file of your project.  Add/change the following lines:
 * \code 
 * CONFIG += no_keywords
 * unix:CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
 * unix:PKGCONFIG += dbus-cxx-1.0
 * \endcode
 * At any point in your QT program, you need to use QT signals or slots, use the macros Q_SIGNALS or Q_SLOTS to define 
 * your signals/slots

/**
 * \page quick_start_initial_concepts Initial Concepts
 * 
 * \section quick_start_concepts_1234 Concepts #1, #2, #3 and #4: Objects (#1), methods (#2), signals (#3) and proxies (#4)
 *
 * \par
 * A dbus-cxx Object is a collection of methods and signals. A method is an
 * operation that may be invoked on a object and may or may not return a value.
 * A signal is emitted by the object and does not have a return value.
 *
 * \par
 * A dbus-cxx ObjectProxy provides an abstration of a remote Object to a client
 * application. The ObjectProxy provides method and signal proxies that have
 * signatures equivalent to their server-side counterparts.
 *
 * \par
 * A method proxy assembles the parameters of the method call into a D-Bus
 * message and transmits to the server. The response (if any) is returned in
 * the form of a D-Bus message which is then unpacked and returned to the
 * application as the return value from the proxy call.
 *
 * \par
 * A signal proxy is different from a method proxy in that it watches an Object
 * for signal events. These signal events arrive as a D-Bus signal message.
 * When a signal event arrives the parameters are unpacked and emitted locally
 * through the signal proxy callback.
 *
 * \section quick_start_concept_5 Concept #5: sigc++ signal and slot library
 * 
 * \par
 * dbus-cxx relies heavily on \c sigc++'s signal and slot system for both
 * Objects and their proxies.
 *
 * \par
 * On the server side and object's methods rely upon slots to provide the
 * underlying functionality. When an incoming method call is invoked, the
 * parameters of the call are unpacked and passed to the slot associated
 * with the method.
 *
 * \par
 * Slots are similar to function pointers in C, but can also be a method
 * of a specific class. The details of this are available in the \c sigc++
 * documentation and are beyond the scope of this tutorial.
 * 
 * \section quick_start_concept_678 Concepts #6, #7 and #8: Smart Pointers, pointer and create()
 * 
 * \par
 * An early design decision was made to focus on the use of smart pointers as
 * defined in the ANSI C++ committee's \c tr1 (Technical Report 1), which as
 * of this writing has been accepted by the committee and recommended to ISO
 * for incorporation as the first revision to the C++ standard. A reference
 * implementation can be found in the boost library, the \c std::tr1 namespace
 * of gcc 4.0 or greater, or the \c C++0x draft standard in gcc 4.3 or greater.
 *
 * \par
 * Two key concepts are the \c pointer typedef and the \c create method defined
 * in each dbus-cxx class.
 *
 * \par
 * The \c pointer typedef is defined \e within \e each \e class and is
 * typedefed to a smart pointer to that \e specific class. Thus,
 * \c DBus::Connection::pointer is a smart pointer to a D-Bus Connection
 * endpoint, and \c DBus::CallMessage::pointer is a smart pointer to a D-Bus
 * call message.
 *
 * \par
 * Each class also has static \c create() methods with parameters that are
 * identical to the class' constructors. Class constructors are \c protected,
 * so in general you cannot access them.
 *
 * \par
 * Instead, you will need to use the class' \c create() method to dynamically
 * creates an instance of the class. This method will returns a smart pointer
 * of the appropriate type for that class similar to the way the \c new
 * operator dynamically creates an object and returns a raw pointer to the
 * newly created object.
 *
 * \par
 * Since the \c create() method is static, you do not need an instance of the
 * class to call it; \c Classname::create() is sufficient. Thus, to create
 * a new dbus-cxx call message you would use \c DBus::CallMessage::create()
 * and to create a new dbus-cxx connection you would use
 * \c DBus::Connection::create().
 *
 * \par
 * Naturally, the smart pointer returned from \c create() can be assigned to
 * the class' \c pointer type, which allows you to use a syntax such as:
 * \code DBus::CallMessage::pointer my_callmessage = DBus::CallMessage::create(); \endcode

 * 
 * \par
 * This example will demonstrate a simple server and client pair.
 *
 * \par
 * The server will only offer one method named \c add that will take two
 * \c double parameters and return the sum as a \c double.
 *
 * \par
 * The client will use a proxy object for the server as well as a proxy for the
 * \c add method.

 * -# Include headers
 * -# Initialize the dbus-cxx library
 * -# Create a dispatcher to manage threads, timeouts and I/O watches
 * -# Create a connection to the D-Bus session bus
 * -# Request a name for our application on the bus
 * -# Create an object on the bus
 * -# Add a method named \c add to our object
 * -# Wait for incoming calls

 * \par
 * Then we will define a function that will be our workhorse on the server side.
 * This function will be the actual function that will be called when the dbus
 * \c add method is invoked, so we will name our function similarly. But, note
 * that the actual name of the function in our program and the name in our
 * dbus server do not have to match.
 * \code double add( double param1, double param2 )      { return param1 + param2; } \endcode
 *
 * \par
 * And now for the beginning of our \c main() function. We'll also declare a
 * variable \c ret that can be used to check the return value of functions.
 * \code{.cpp}
 * int main()
 * {
 *   int ret;
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Initialize the dbus-cxx library
 * Before we do anything in dbus-cxx we must call the library's \c init() method
 * which will take care of various initializations including the threading system.
 * \code DBus::init(); \endcode
 *
 * \par Create a dispatcher to manage threads, timeouts and I/O watches
 * Now, we will create a dispatcher to handle incoming and outgoing messages.
 * Handling incoming and outgoing messages can be messy and the Dispatcher
 * class handles much of this for us.
 * \code DBus::Dispatcher::pointer dispatcher = DBus::Dispatcher::create(); \endcode
 *
 * \par Create a connection to the D-Bus session bus
 * Now that we have a dispatcher we need to create a connection to the session bus.
 * \code DBus::Connection::pointer conn = dispatcher->create_connection(DBus::BUS_SESSION); \endcode
 *
 * \par Request a name for our application on the bus
 * Next, we need to request a name that will identify our application on the
 * session bus.
 * \code
 *   ret = conn->request_name( "dbuscxx.quickstart_0.server", DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING );
 *   if (DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER != ret) return 1;
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Create an object on the bus
 * Now that our application has a name on the bus we need to add an object with
 * it's path.
 * \code DBus::Object::pointer object = conn->create_object("/dbuscxx/quickstart_0"); \endcode
 *
 * \par Add a method named \c add to our object
 * We will now create a method named \c add for our object. The functionality
 * of the method will be provided by the function we declared above also named
 * \c add(). We must add this to an interface, and the D-Bus specification
 * required that interface names must contain at least one \b . (period)
 * character so we will use the interface name \c "dbuscxx.Quickstart".
 *
 * \par
 * Note that our object's method named \c add has nothing to do with C++
 * class methods. In essence we are creating virtual objects on the D-Bus
 * and can choose to provide their functionality with either C++ class methods
 * and/or plain functions.
 * \code object->create_method<double,double,double>("dbuscxx.Quickstart", "add", sigc::ptr_fun(add) ); \endcode
 *
 * \par Wait for incoming calls
 * Finally, we need to wait for incoming calls. We will sleep for 10 seconds in
 * our \c main() function and the calls will be handled in the dispatcher's
 * threads.
 * \code
 * sleep(10);
 *   
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * \endcode

 * \section quick_start_server_0 A simple client
 *
 * \par
 * This section provides an example of a simple client for our simple server.
 *
 * \par Summary
 * This is an overview of the code we will need in our example client:
 * -# Include headers
 * -# Initialize the dbus-cxx library
 * -# Create a dispatcher to manage threads, timeouts and I/O watches
 * -# Create a connection to the D-Bus session bus
 * -# Create a proxy object for the server's \c quickstart_0 object
 * -# Create a proxy \c add method for our proxy object
 * -# Call our proxy method
 * -# Print out the results
 *
 * \section quick_start_client_0_code Simple client 0 code
 *
 * \par
 * Here is the code in full, followed by a section-by-section discussion.
 *
 * \include quickstart_client_0.cpp
 *
 * \section quick_start_client_0_discussion Simple client 0 code discussion
 *
 * \par Include headers
 * First, we need to include the main dbus-cxx library header. We'll also
 * include the \c iostream header since we'll print out the results
 * of our addition.
 * \code
 * #include <dbus-cxx.h>
 * #include <iostream>
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par
 * And now for the beginning of our \c main() function.
 * \code
 * int main()
 * {
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Initialize the dbus-cxx library
 * Before we do anything in dbus-cxx we must call the library's \c init() method
 * which will take care of various initializations including the threading system.
 * \code DBus::init(); \endcode
 *
 * \par Create a dispatcher to manage threads, timeouts and I/O watches
 * Now, we will create a dispatcher to handle incoming and outgoing messages.
 * Handling incoming and outgoing messages can be messy and the Dispatcher
 * class handles much of this for us.
 * \code DBus::Dispatcher::pointer dispatcher = DBus::Dispatcher::create(); \endcode
 *
 * \par Create a connection to the D-Bus session bus
 * Now that we have a dispatcher we need to create a connection to the session bus.
 * \code DBus::Connection::pointer conn = dispatcher->create_connection(DBus::BUS_SESSION); \endcode
 *
 * \par
 * \par Request a name for our application on the bus
 * Next, we need to request a name that will identify our application on the
 * session bus.
 * \code
 *   ret = conn->request_name( "dbuscxx.quickstart_0.server", DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING );
 *   if (DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER != ret) return 1;
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Create a proxy object for the server's \c quickstart_0 object
 * You'll notice that up to this point the code for the client and the server
 * has been nearly identical. This is the point at which they will diverge.
 * We will now create a proxy object for the object on the server.
 * \code
 *   DBus::ObjectProxy::pointer object;
 *   object = connection->create_object_proxy("dbuscxx.quickstart_0.server", "/dbuscxx/quickstart_0");
 * \endcode
 * Note that we must use the name the server requested as well as the object
 * path the server used when it created it's object when we create the
 * proxy object.
 *
 * \par Create a proxy \c add method for our proxy object
 * Now we create a proxy \c add method for the server object's \c add method.
 * This will allow us to use function notation to call the method. When
 * creating the proxy method we must use the same interface
 * (\c "dbuscxx.Quickstart" ) and method name ( \c "add" ) as the server used.
 * \code
 *   DBus::MethodProxy<double,double,double>& add_proxy
 *     = *(object->create_method<double,double,double>("dbuscxx.Quickstart","add"));
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Call our proxy method
 * Now we can use our proxy method to call the method on the server using
 * function notation. We'll keep things simple and just add \c 1.1 \c + \c 2.2 .
 * \code
 *   double answer;
 *   answer = add_proxy( 1.1, 2.2 );
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Print out the results
 * Finally, we can print out the results.
 * \code
 *   std::cout << "1.1 + 2.2 = " << answer << std::endl;
 *
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * \endcode
