# Doxyfile 1.8.8

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = dbus-cxx

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is included in
# the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55 pixels
# and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy the logo
# to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = "@SRCDIR@/doc/images/dbus-cxx-logo-doxygen.png"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = "@BUILDDIR@/doc/reference/"

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES then an undocumented member inherits the
# documentation from any documented member that it re-implements.
# The default value is: YES.

INHERIT_DOCS           = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 8

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) defined
# locally in source files will be included in the documentation. If set to NO
# only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect
# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = NO

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented classes that are normally visible in the class hierarchy. If set
# to NO these classes will be included in the various overviews. This option has
# no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = YES

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable ( YES) or disable ( NO) the
# todo list. This list is created by putting \todo commands in the
# documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_TODOLIST      = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.

QUIET                  = YES

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are
# generated to standard error ( stderr) by doxygen. If WARNINGS is set to YES
# this implies that the warnings are on.
#
# Tip: Turn warnings on while writing the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

WARNINGS               = YES

# If the WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED tag is set to YES, then doxygen will generate
# warnings for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag
# will automatically be disabled.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

                         "@SRCDIR@/doc"

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                = "@SRCDIR@/dbus-cxx/daemon-proxy/README.md"

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

EXAMPLE_PATH           = "@SRCDIR@/examples/"

# If the value of the EXAMPLE_PATH tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXAMPLE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank all
# files are included.

EXAMPLE_PATTERNS       = *.h \
                         *.cpp \
                         *.xml

# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be
# searched for input files to be used with the \include or \dontinclude commands
# irrespective of the value of the RECURSIVE tag.
# The default value is: NO.

EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE      = YES

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = "@SRCDIR@/doc/images"

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to source browsing

# function all documented functions referencing it will be listed.
# The default value is: NO.

REFERENCED_BY_RELATION = YES

# If the REFERENCES_RELATION tag is set to YES then for each documented function
# all documented entities called/used by that function will be listed.
# The default value is: NO.

REFERENCES_RELATION    = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML header file for
# each generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard header.
#
# To get valid HTML the header file that includes any scripts and style sheets
# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            = "@SRCDIR@/doc/doxygen_header.html"

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefor more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra stylesheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# stylesheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list). For an example see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = "@SRCDIR@/doc/customdoxygen.css"

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath^ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that the
# files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# This tag specifies a string that should uniquely identify the documentation
# set bundle. This should be a reverse domain-name style string, e.g.
# com.mycompany.MyDocSet. Doxygen will append .docset to the name.
# The default value is: org.doxygen.Project.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_DOCSET is set to YES.

DOCSET_BUNDLE_ID       = net.sourceforge.dbus-cxx

# The QHP_NAMESPACE tag specifies the namespace to use when generating Qt Help
# Project output. For more information please see Qt Help Project / Namespace
# (see: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qthelpproject.html#namespace).
# The default value is: org.doxygen.Project.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_QHP is set to YES.

QHP_NAMESPACE          = net.sourceforge.dbus-cxx

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom stylesheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for
# the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript and DHTML and
# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

SEARCHENGINE           = NO

# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used by the
# printer.
# Possible values are: a4 (210 x 297 mm), letter (8.5 x 11 inches), legal (8.5 x
# 14 inches) and executive (7.25 x 10.5 inches).
# The default value is: a4.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

PAPER_TYPE             = letter

# If the PDF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the LaTeX that is generated is
# prepared for conversion to PDF (using ps2pdf or pdflatex). The PDF file will
# contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references. This
# makes the output suitable for online browsing using a PDF viewer.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

PDF_HYPERLINKS         = NO

# If the USE_PDFLATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will use pdflatex to generate
# the PDF file directly from the LaTeX files. Set this option to YES to get a
# higher quality PDF documentation.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

USE_PDFLATEX           = NO

# If the LATEX_BATCHMODE tag is set to YES, doxygen will add the \batchmode
# command to the generated LaTeX files. This will instruct LaTeX to keep running
# if errors occur, instead of asking the user for help. This option is also used
# when generating formulas in HTML.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_BATCHMODE        = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the XML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES doxygen will generate an XML file that

GENERATE_XML           = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES, doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO, only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting

# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES then
# the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the PREDEFINED and
# EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then this
# tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded. The
# macro definition that is found in the sources will be used. Use the PREDEFINED
# tag if you want to use a different macro definition that overrules the
# definition found in the source code.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

EXPAND_AS_DEFINED      = DBUSCXX_ERROR

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to external references
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When a file name is specified after GENERATE_TAGFILE, doxygen will create a

# external documentation" for more information about the usage of tag files.

GENERATE_TAGFILE       = "@BUILDDIR@/doc/dbus-cxx_doxygen_tags"

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When you want a differently looking font in the dot files that doxygen
# generates you can specify the font name using DOT_FONTNAME. You need to make
# sure dot is able to find the font, which can be done by putting it in a
# standard location or by setting the DOTFONTPATH environment variable or by
# setting DOT_FONTPATH to the directory containing the font.
# The default value is: Helvetica.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_FONTNAME           = FreeSans

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a
# graph for each documented class showing the direct and indirect implementation
# dependencies (inheritance, containment, and class references variables) of the
# class with other documented classes.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

COLLABORATION_GRAPH    = NO

# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent
# background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not seem
# to support this out of the box.
#
# Warning: Depending on the platform used, enabling this option may lead to
# badly anti-aliased labels on the edges of a graph (i.e. they become hard to
# read).
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_TRANSPARENT        = YES

# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This
# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) support
# this, this feature is disabled by default.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_MULTI_TARGETS      = YES
